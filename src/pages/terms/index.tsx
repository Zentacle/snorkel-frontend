These references do not imply that Zentacle intends to announce such services or content in your country. The Products are controlled and offered by Zentacle from its facilities in the United States of America. Zentacle makes no representations that the Products are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Products from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law. </span><span className="c5">14.8</span><span className="c10 c9">&nbsp;ARBITRATION PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS (THE &ldquo;ARBITRATION AGREEMENT&rdquo;) CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH ZENTACLE, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM ZENTACLE.</span></p>
      <ul className="c1 lst-kix_3b5cj84mk5iq-0 start">
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Zentacle are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Zentacle. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Zentacle for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Zentacle. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Zentacle.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Jury Trial Waiver. You and Zentacle waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and Zentacle elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and Zentacle over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Zentacle waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c9 c10">className Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ZENTACLE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR className MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED className OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of className or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Zentacle are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 14.9 below.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c9">Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. To opt-out, you must notify Zentacle in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your Member Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Zentacle, Inc, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 30 W 18th St, New York, NY 10011; </span><span className="c11">support@zentacle.com</span><span className="c10 c9">.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Zentacle may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></li>
        <li className="c4 li-bullet-0"><span className="c10 c9">Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Zentacle.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p className="c2"><span className="c5">14.9</span><span className="c9">&nbsp;EXCLUSIVE VENUE To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Zentacle agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. If, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. You and Zentacle consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts. </span><span className="c5">14.10</span><span className="c9">&nbsp;CHOICE OF LAW Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims. </span><span className="c5">14.11</span><span className="c9">&nbsp;CONSUMER COMPLAINTS In accordance with California Civil Code &sect;1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210. </span><span className="c5">14.12</span><span className="c9">&nbsp;GOVERNMENT RIGHTS Zentacle provides the Products, including any related software, data, and technology, for ultimate government end use solely in accordance with the following: The Products shall constitute &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; computer software. Government technical data and software rights related to the Products include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in these Terms. These customary commercial licenses are provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and FAR 12.212 (Customer-Side Application) and, for Department of Defense transactions, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data &ndash; Commercial Items) and DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Customer-Side Application or Computer Customer-Side Application Documentation). If a government agency has a need for rights not granted under these Terms, it must negotiate with Zentacle to determine if there are acceptable terms for granting those rights, and a mutually acceptable written addendum specifically granting those rights must be included in any applicable agreement. If any law, rule or regulation requires these Terms to include a specific provision or clause in order to render these Terms enforceable against any ultimate government end user, such provision or clause will be deemed to be a part of these Terms. </span><span className="c5">14.13</span><span className="c9">&nbsp;ENTIRE AGREEMENT These Terms constitute the whole agreement between us and supersede all previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement between us relating to their subject matter. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Neither of you or Zentacle is an agent, employee, or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Zentacle&rsquo;s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Zentacle may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees. </span><span className="c5">14.14</span><span className="c10 c9">&nbsp;CONTACT Zentacle, Inc is located at 30 W 18th St, New York, NY 10011.</span></p>

A user who purchases a Gift Subscription (a &ldquo;Giftor&rdquo;) must designate a specific recipient at the time of purchase, who will receive and has the option to redeem a Gift Subscription (&ldquo;Recipient&rdquo;) for a Subscription to certain Products. The Initial Term of such Subscription commences on the date that the Gift Subscription is redeemed for a Subscription. All fees and charges related to Gift Subscriptions are incurred and charged as a one-time payment at the time of the Giftor&rsquo;s Order of such Gift Subscription. A Giftor may specify the date on which a Gift Subscription will be delivered to the Recipient. The Giftor will receive an Order confirmation and receipt. The Gift Subscription will be sent to the Recipient on the date specified by the Giftor, and is valid to be redeemed for a Subscription during the term specified at point of purchase (the &ldquo;Expiration Period&rdquo;). If there was no Expiration Period specified at point of purchase or the Gift Subscription was purchased before October 16, 2021, such Gift Subscription will not expire. A Gift Subscription can only be redeemed once, is not transferable, and may only be used in the country for which it was purchased. A Gift Subscription cannot be redeemed for cash, resold, or combined with any other offers.
